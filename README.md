In the form of, we have two data types in javascript 
##### Primitive 
which holds single value inside the variable 
**like** `String`, `Boolean`, `Interger`, `Float`, `Null`, `Undefine`.

Data Type which help us to know what type are data or which format data have returned from the vaiable, 
**Let take a example :**
`
let name = "Masum";
`

In the **javascript**, have a fucntion which help to get the type of data `typeof()`, we put the variable inside the funciton get print the type of data.
